Sequence Aviator Demo
=====================

This is a basic game demo that leverages [Sequence](https://sequence.xyz/)'s Wallet as a Service capabilities to seamlessly authenticate the player and create a multi-chain capable wallet behind the scenes. [Sequence stack](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) can then be further used to trigger contracts, award NFTs or other tokens, etc.

You can [play a demo of the game here](https://0xsequence.github.io/aviator-demo/).

## Usage

To play the game locally, clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can also use `npm run build` to generate a static, deployable version.
