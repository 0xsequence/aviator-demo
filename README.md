Sequence Aviator Demo
=====================

This is a basic game demo that leverages [Sequence](https://sequence.xyz/)'s Embedded Wallet capabilities to seamlessly authenticate the player and create a multi-chain capable wallet behind the scenes. [Sequence stack](https://github.com/0xsequence/sequence.js) can then be further used to trigger contracts, award NFTs or other tokens, etc.

You can [play a demo of the game here](https://0xsequence.github.io/aviator-demo/).

## Usage

To play the game locally, clone the repo and run:

```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

You can also use `pnpm run build` to generate a static, deployable version.

## CREDITS

Game is ported from the [WebGL tutorial by Karim Maaloul](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/).
